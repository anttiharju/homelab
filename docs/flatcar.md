# Flatcar Container Linux

Flatcar Container Linux [1] is being pursued to.

1. Simplify reprovisionability (vs. doing everything at runtime via Ansible)
2. It's not AWS-centric and supports arm64, unlike Bottlerocket
3. It's a CNCF project unlike Fedora CoreOS
   - Even though it is an incubating project, it's a direct fork of CoreOS from days of yore, even if Fedora's naming would suggest otherwise.
